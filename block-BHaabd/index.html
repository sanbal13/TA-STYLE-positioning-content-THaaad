                <p>
                    In our urban and suburban houses what should we do without cats? In our
                    sitting or bedrooms, our libraries, in our kitchens and storerooms, our farms, 
                    barns, and rickyards, in our docks, our granaries, our ships, and our
                    wharves, in oue corn markets, meat markets, and other places too numerous
                    to mention, how useful they are! In our ships, however, the rats oft set them
                    at defiance; still they are of great service.
                </p>
                <p>
                    How wonderfully patient is the cat when watching for rats or mice, awaiting
                    their egress from their place of refuge or that which is their home! How well
                    Shakespeare in Pericles, Act iii., describes this keen attention of the cat to 
                    its natural pursuit! 
                </p>
                <p class ="margin-para">
                    The cat, with eyne of burning coal, Now crouches from (before)
                    the mouse's hole.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A slight rustle, and the fugitive comes forth; a quick, sharp, resolute motion,
                    and the cat has proved its usefulness. Let any one have a plague of rats and
                    mice, as I once had, and let them be delivered therefrom by cats, as I was,
                    and they will have a lasting and kind regard for them.

                    delivered therefrom
